## Project: Speech-to-Text and Content Summarization with Language Models  

### Overview  
This project implements a comprehensive system to convert audio recordings into text, summarize content, and provide an intuitive user interface. It is designed for students and educators who want to maximize the value of their lecture recordings.  

### Features  
1. **Text Generation with LLMs**:  
   - Utilizes a model from the Hugging Face library to generate text.  
   - Explores key parameters that influence model output.  
   - Offers flexibility to switch between different language models.  

2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**:  
   - Integrates OpenAIâ€™s Whisper technology for accurate transcription of audio recordings.  

3. **Content Summarization**:  
   - Leverages IBM Watson AI to effectively summarize transcripts and extract key points.  

4. **Interactive User Interface**:  
   - Developed an intuitive interface using Hugging Face Gradio, ensuring ease of use for students and educators.  

### Achievements  
- Built a solid foundation for leveraging Language Models (LLMs) for text generation and processing tasks.  
- Applied cutting-edge technologies like OpenAI Whisper and IBM Watson AI.  
- Designed and implemented an accessible and efficient solution for end-users.
